>Git’s collaboration model is based on repository-to-repository interaction.
Instead of checking a working copy into SVN’s central repository, you push or pull commits from one repository to another. Developing a project revolves around the basic edit/stage/commit pattern Git developers have the opportunity to accumulate commits in their local repo. Staging area is a buffer between the working directory and the project history. lets developers work in an isolated environment, deferring integration until they’re at a convenient break point. SVN commit consists of a diff compared to the original file added to the repository. Git, on the other hand, records the entire contents of each file in every commit.


# git init
The git init command creates a new Git repository.
Needs to be executed only once.
Common use is to create a central repository.

```sh
 git init <directory>
```
Create an empty Git repository in the specified directory

```sh
 git init --bare <directory_name.git>
```
Initialize an empty Git repository, but omit the working directory. 
Doesn’t have a working directory
Impossible to edit files and commit changes in that repository.
Central repositories should always be created as bare repositories.
All Git work-flows, the central repository is bare, and developers local repositories are non-bare
##### Example
```sh
SSH <user>@<host>
cd path/above/repo
git init --base <my-central-project.git>
```

# git clone
Copies an existing Git repository.
something similar to svn checkout
Additionally
full-fledged Git repository
has its own history
is a completely isolated environment from the original repository
automatically creates a remote connection called "origin" pointing back to the original repository.

```sh
 git clone <repo>
```
Clone the repository located at <repo> onto the local machine
original repository can be located on the local filesystem
original repository can be located on remote machine accessible via HTTP or SSH

```sh
 git clone <repo> <directory
```
Clone the repository located at <repo> into the folder called <directory> on the local machine.
most common way for users to obtain a development copy
generally a one-time operation

# git config
lets you configure your Git installation (or an individual repository) from the command line.
Define everything from user info, preferences, behavior of a repository
All configuration options are stored in plaintext files, so the git config command is really just a convenient command-line interface
```sh
<repo>/.git/config –> Local Repository-specific settings.
~/.gitconfig –> User-specific settings. options set with --global flag.
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig – System-wide settings.
```
```sh
 git config user.name <name>
```
Define author name to be used for all commits in the current repository

```sh
 git config --global user.name <name>
```
Define the author name to be used for all commits by the current user.

```sh
 git config --global user.email <email>
```
Define the author email to be used for all commits by the current user.

```sh
 git config --global alias.<alias-name> <git-command>
```
Create a shortcut for a Git command.

```sh
 git config --system core.editor <editor>
```
Define the text editor used by commands like git commit for all users on the current machine


# git add
The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area
tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.
git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.

```sh
 git add <file>
```
Stage all changes in <file> for the next commit.
```sh
 git add <directory>
```
Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit.
```sh
 git add -p
```
- y : to stage the chunk
- n : to ignore the chunk
- s : to split it into smaller chunks
- e : to manually edit the chunk
- q to exit

# git commit
Commit the staged snapshot
will launch a text editor prompting you for a commit message

```sh
 git commit -m "<message>"
```
instead of launching a text editor, use <message> as the commit message

```sh
 git commit -a
```
Commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directory
should have been added with git add

# git status 
To view the state of the working directory and the staging area.

# git log
The git log command displays committed snapshots
only operates on the committed history.
Display the entire commit history using the default formatting
If the output takes up more than one screen, you can use Space to scroll and q to exit

```sh
 git log -n <limit>
```
Limit the number of commits by <limit>. For example, git log -n 3 will display only 3 commits.

```sh
 git log --oneline
```
Condense each commit to a single line. This is useful for getting a high-level overview of the project history.

```sh
 git log --stat
```
include which files were altered and the relative number of lines that were added or deleted from each of them.

```sh
 git log -p
```
Display the patch representing each commit.
This shows the full diff of each commit, which is the most detailed view you can have of your project history

```sh
 git log --author="<pattern>"
```
Search for commits with a commit message that matches <pattern>, 
can be a plain string or a regular expression.

```sh
 git log <since>..<until>
```
Show only commits that occur between <since> and <until>
Both arguments can be either a commit ID, a branch name, HEAD, or any other kind of revision reference

```sh
 git log <file>
```
Only display commits that include the specified file. This is an easy way to see the history of a particular file.

# example
git log --graph --decorate --oneline
```
—graph flag that will draw a text based graph of the commits on the left hand side
—decorate adds the names of branches or tags of the commits
—oneline shows the commit information on a single line

```sh
 git log --author="John Smith" -p hello.py
```
display a full diff of all the changes John Smith has made to the file hello.py

```sh
 git log --oneline master..some-feature
```
comparing branches

# git checkout
checking out files
checking out commits and 
checking out branches

```sh
 git checkout master
```
Return to the master branch

```sh
 git checkout <commit> <file>
```
urns the <file> that resides in the working directory into an exact copy of the one from <commit>
adds it to the staging area

```sh
 git checkout <commit>
```
Update all files in the working directory to match the specified commit. 
can use either a commit hash or a tag as the <commit> argument. 
This will put you in a detached HEAD state.
















Create a new repository on the command line
echo # quick-git >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/touchchandra/quick-git.git
git push -u origin master

push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/touchchandra/quick-git.git
git push -u origin master
